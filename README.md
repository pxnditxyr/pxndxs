> **"Code, Science, and Entropy."**

Welcome to my **Digital Laboratory**. This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio, **[pxndxs.com](https://pxndxs.com)**. It serves as a showcase of my work as a **Lead Full-Stack Developer** and a playground for my interests in **Particle Physics** and **AI**.

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project is not just a portfolio; it's an experiment in performance and user experience. Designed to be lightweight and visually engaging, it mimics a "quantum lab" environment.

### Key Features
* **⚛️ Interactive Particle System:** A custom HTML5 Canvas background simulating atomic movement, written in vanilla JS (no heavy libraries).
* **🌗 Dynamic Theme System:** Persistent Dark/Light mode support (because every developer needs a dark mode).
* **⚡ High Performance:** Built with **Astro** for zero-JS frontend architecture by default, ensuring maximum speed and SEO.
* **🎨 Styling:** Utility-first styling with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, glassmorphism aesthetic.
* **🐼 The "Team":** A unique "About" section featuring my digital pair programmers (Pandas & Cats).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Periodic Table)

This project relies on a modern, type-safe stack:

| Technology | Symbol | Role |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Astro** | `As` | Core Framework (Static Site Generation) |
| **TypeScript** | `Ts` | Logic & Type Safety |
| **Tailwind CSS** | `Tw` | Styling & Responsive Design |
| **Rust** | `Rs` | (In Spirit) The mindset of safety & speed |
